The Product Hunt Daily Hot List is an automation tool based on GitHub Action. It automatically generates a Markdown file of the top trending products on Product Hunt every day and submits it to a GitHub repository. This project aims to help users quickly view the daily Product Hunt hot list and provide more detailed product information.

On top of the original project, features have been added to automatically update to Feishu and support calling Dify's API as a replacement for the OpenAI API.

The list is automatically updated every day at 3 PM, and you can view it [üåê here](https://sxwqam5d2bh.feishu.cn/docx/S2mTdzFrToxGSjx4aAgc4fDBnjb?from=from_copylink).
